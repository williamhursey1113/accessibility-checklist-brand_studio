00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.960
when you think of creativity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:15.920
when you think of innovation the last place&nbsp;
you may think of is baton rouge louisiana

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.520
we're an underdog agency in an underdog state&nbsp;
and we love to work with underdog brands

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.480
my name is jeremy bate i am&nbsp;
the co-founder here at 368&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.440
and the operating chief creative officer here&nbsp;
at our headquarters in baton rouge louisiana&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.920
it's being underestimated that allows&nbsp;
us to be so good because we come in with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:04.000
a drive and an ambition that other teams may not&nbsp;
have and we work with brands who match that energy

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.760
to most people we're a marketing agency but&nbsp;
we don't act like most marketing agencies

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
we love making things that are ambitious&nbsp;
uncommon and creative and we love using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.800
technology to make those things we shy away&nbsp;
from traditional advertising whenever we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.240
we try not to interrupt people with ads and things&nbsp;
that they don't really want to see and we try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.840
give people things that they can use and have fun&nbsp;
with and engage with and add value to their lives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:50.080
prior to tim coming into our world we were aware&nbsp;
of no code tools but they weren't necessarily&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.320
exciting or attractive to us then enter tim we've&nbsp;
been working on this project for weeks on end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.600
it was a really complex homepage&nbsp;
interaction and it was a struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.480
here comes tim rolling into&nbsp;
work his first or second week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.800
and invites us over to his desk and says hey i&nbsp;
just want to show y'all something i did last night&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.720
opens up a complete replica of this&nbsp;
homepage experience fully functional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.080
on webflow and in fact it was better than the&nbsp;
working prototype that we had done or that we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.680
working on and i think everyone on the team at&nbsp;
that moment was we were all motivated to embrace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.080
webflow as a tool and to re-imagine&nbsp;
no code as a component of our process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.600
hi i'm timothy ricks i'm a senior design engineer&nbsp;
at 368 and an educator in the no code space&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.280
so no code to me is being able to build something&nbsp;
without having to actually write the code&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.320
it's opened up a new set of tools that no&nbsp;
one else had before except a very select&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.480
set of people that really allows us as&nbsp;
creatives to have full potential to build&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.000
whatever we want it reduces that barrier to&nbsp;
entry to where anyone can come up with an idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.120
and spend more time and energy on the end product&nbsp;
really making sure that it connects with people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.760
that it sets the right tone the right emotions&nbsp;
because we're less worried about the technology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.840
or the how to do it and we're more focused&nbsp;
on the best way to make something happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.280
we've got a history of growth so we've&nbsp;
grown almost 100 year-over-year as an agency&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:55.680
from 2017-28 all the way into 2020 we had unlocked&nbsp;
this recent no code capability and it was it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.360
helping us drive a new way of working a&nbsp;
new way of even bringing value to clients&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.960
to that point we had really been built on&nbsp;
the energy within the walls of this office&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.920
it was just like a buzzing frenetic place and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.960
was what drove us we'd bring clients in they&nbsp;
were feeding off of the energy and so yeah

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:24.720
early march 2020 and i remember being in&nbsp;
philadelphia and the news broke that everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.320
needed to get home before they were going to&nbsp;
start grounding flights and locking things down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.840
most of our clients called and said hey we're&nbsp;
just pausing everything right now we just don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.520
know what's happening we're gonna pause and for&nbsp;
us that was terrifying because that's revenue&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:48.640
that's cash flow that's future it was a few&nbsp;
weeks after that that we were working from home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.680
i think the biggest challenge working remote for&nbsp;
me was just not seeing everyone from a day to day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.400
i'd kind of grown accustomed to that energy of&nbsp;
being able to just look over my shoulder and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.120
some help on the design or get some feedback this&nbsp;
was a world where we gathered around desks and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.720
looked at a screen together and then we grabbed&nbsp;
watch suddenly we're thrust into this world where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:22.640
you're on a zoom you end call and you're alone&nbsp;
again how do we collaborate how do we create&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:30.800
how do we have those water cooler moments in&nbsp;
a vacuum we hit a low as a team where it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.600
almost like we ran out of gas for a minute there&nbsp;
i don't know if any of us knew how we were going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:46.080
to go into 2021 and so we were faced with this&nbsp;
change and made a quick decision to embrace it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.240
like everything before it's&nbsp;
uncomfortable but it is what it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.880
and you can't focus on how it should of what it&nbsp;
could have been you have to focus on how it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.760
you start to switch from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.640
this is an obstacle that we have to get through&nbsp;
to this is a reality that we have to live with

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.320
i think of it almost as there was a light at&nbsp;
the end of the tunnel and that light almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:27.520
went out and when you hit that point where you're&nbsp;
in the dark you have to create your own light

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.120
we got together as a team and decided&nbsp;
to create that life or at least to try

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:44.080
my mom's a nurse and she was in the hospital and&nbsp;
every day coming home and telling me how hard it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.360
was and we just thought there has to be something&nbsp;
we could do to make a positive impact for our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.880
healthcare workers who are really one of the ones&nbsp;
feeling the brunt of this whole situation and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:05.200
we came up with our clever viral positivity&nbsp;
idea which was a play on the negativity of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.960
the pandemic and the the virus and we said&nbsp;
what if we made positivity just as contagious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.800
we leveraged no code tools to create a platform&nbsp;
where people could go to this website and leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.920
messages of encouragement positivity for&nbsp;
frontline workers that were public anyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:30.160
could see so it would catch on we also added in a&nbsp;
donation component where people could donate money&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.440
actually the way we did it was we partnered with&nbsp;
brands so instead of just giving people money and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.880
saying hey this will solve your problems&nbsp;
we took care of people we did car washes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.640
spa days things like that so we relied pretty&nbsp;
heavily on no code tools for viral positivity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.920
the main one being webflow we were able to use&nbsp;
other combinations of no code tools to really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.360
make the experience so much more seamless like the&nbsp;
ability for users to like a message or the ability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.560
to reshare it or cycle through random messages&nbsp;
so that way it really kept the experience fresh

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.800
the interesting part about this project is that&nbsp;
it wasn't a project it wasn't scheduled in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.200
project management software it was pure grit and&nbsp;
volunteer effort and it seemed like everyone was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:26.560
involved you know everyone was hopping into these&nbsp;
zooms people were throwing design work in concepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.720
kenny was in the front end networking building&nbsp;
relationships making phone calls saying hey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.240
can we partner with this car wash over here can&nbsp;
we partner with this food service over there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.840
i think it was the one light&nbsp;
in the darkness at that moment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.240
that everyone could grab onto so&nbsp;
it felt it was a source of energy

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.360
i didn't know what to expect with this project&nbsp;
when we did it to be totally honest it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:07.840
a little bit for us as much as it was for everyone&nbsp;
else we needed something to believe in we needed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:17.360
to feel like we were helping so my expectations&nbsp;
were that we would at least be able to contribute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.120
and i didn't know if anyone else would&nbsp;
would jump on fortunately they did

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:30.240
what we saw is patients started sharing stories&nbsp;
of how their nurses saved the day and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.320
people who had friends and family who worked in&nbsp;
healthcare started posting shout outs about them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.280
and then we worked with hospitals to allow&nbsp;
the site to be shared on their screens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.840
and cycle through encouraging messages throughout&nbsp;
the day to really enforce that encouragement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:49.520
we were screenshotting people's comments and&nbsp;
posting them into slack saying did you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.480
this look at that wow we've got two pages we&nbsp;
got three pages we have four pages of comments&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.440
and then kenny would say look at&nbsp;
the donations that are rolling in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.800
whenever i first heard that the&nbsp;
donations were approaching six figures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.920
i couldn't believe it it's rare&nbsp;
that you get that kind of impact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:14.240
and then uh going through and reading the comments&nbsp;
themselves i mean it was honestly emotional

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:21.280
i went through every single one and just like&nbsp;
i think i was in tears at one point just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:29.200
reading these things feeling the collective will&nbsp;
to move forward and the will to to persevere was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:40.800
powerful for people facing obstacles facing change&nbsp;
um something we say here all the time it's from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.440
a book you may have read is i'd say the obstacle&nbsp;
is the way in order for traction to happen there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:53.200
has to be friction so that obstacle that change&nbsp;
that makes you uncomfortable that's the friction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:59.840
you can grab onto to move forward so see it that&nbsp;
way use the friction i call it positive friction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:06.400
so the obstacle is the way for this&nbsp;
project it wouldn't have happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.200
without no code tools because it needed to&nbsp;
happen quickly it happened outside of process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.480
with limited resources and we needed a way&nbsp;
to get something interactive and engaging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:29.200
to the world quickly as i look into the future&nbsp;
i see no code unlocking creativity for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:33.280
we're going to see awesome ideas come out&nbsp;
of places that we would least expect it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:39.440
we can already see what is done for designers&nbsp;
being able to develop sites with very little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.480
knowledge of code imagine when that becomes&nbsp;
accessible to everyone the type of things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:52.400
that we're going to see no code and low code tools&nbsp;
ultimately allow us to reimagine the possibilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.400 --> 00:12:02.960
on the internet and we're excited about what&nbsp;
the world will look like when we're done
